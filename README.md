# Local QrCoding

Local QrCoding is a pure Chrome extension to generate QRcode for the url of the current tab.

##Install
I attempt to submit it to Chrome Webstore, but Google ask me to pay $5 at first to become a developer.
Uhn....I decide to pay when I can pay...If someone want to donate $5 to me, it will be nice too, haha.

So you can only use install file.

1. Open [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions/)
2. Download the extension at [here](https://github.com/Garnel/Local-Qrcoding/raw/master/extension/Local%20QrCoding.crx).
3. Drag the downloaded ctx file to the `extensions` page you opened at step 1 and install it.

##Dependence
Local QrCoding makes use of [`qrcode.js`](http://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/ "qrcode.js") as well as [`jquery`](http://jquery.com/ "jquery").

And also a code snippet from `CSS-TRICKS` at [http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/triple-click-event/](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/triple-click-event/ "Triple Click Event")
